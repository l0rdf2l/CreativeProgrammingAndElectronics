Describe your inspiration, and include links
The inspiration for the drawing was the [Olympic rings](https://www.google.com/search?q=olympic+rings&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS797US797&sxsrf=ALeKk00-WsXyeB8hNUAhAB-HdIPqCztndg:1594601350569&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW2bv4gMnqAhWTFzQIHabtDSoQ_AUoAXoECBYQAw&biw=1920&bih=937). 
Describe the rules you used to create this artwork and briefly how you programmed this to happen.

The main difficulty I faced was understanding how to "reset" the translation. It was a problem when I was programming my second ring because it was translating based on the origin from the first ring; After some Googling the pushMatrix() and popMatrix() functions could be used to reset the origin back to (0, 0).

Something I found interesting was that hex color codes could be used when assigning colors. Also, learning the power of the pushMatrix() and popMatrix() functions was really interesting.
