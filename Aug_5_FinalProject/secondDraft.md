For Processing, I want to explore the OpenCV library. Mainly because I want to learn more about the face detection and tracking functionality of the library.

For Arduino, I want to explore the Sparkfun Motor Driver using the Prototyping Shield.

What I want to achieve is being able to control a two wheeled car through face/motion detection. Or maybe when the camera detects a certain object, the car moves forward etc. 

Materials I'll need would be everything in the sparkfun kit and a webcam.

The riskiest part would be using OpenCV because I would need to figure out how to not only make it work, but be able to work along with my Arduino code.
