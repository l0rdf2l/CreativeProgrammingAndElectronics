# Music Instrument

My music instrument is meant to be a metrenome that hits against objects in conjunction with the song of Canon in D. The stick attatchment to the servo that acts as the arm of the metrenome was quite tricky to attach. Problems I am still facing is getting the servo to move along with the song playing at the same time. 

Here are pictures of my instrument!
